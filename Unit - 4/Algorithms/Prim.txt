Prim's algorithm for constructing a minimum spanning tree

Prim(G)
Input: A weighted connected graph G = <V,E>
Output: ET, the set of edges composing a minimum spanning tree of G

VT <- {v0} //the set of tree vertices can be initialized with any vertex
ET <- ∅
for i <- 1 to |V| − 1 do
    find a minimum-weight edge e∗ = (v∗, u∗) among all the edges (v, u)
    such that v is in VT and u is in V − VT
    VT <- VT ∪ {u∗}
    ET <- ET ∪ {e∗}
return ET

Time complexity: O(|E|log|V|)
