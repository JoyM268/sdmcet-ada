Implements Warshall’s algorithm for computing the transitive closure

Warshall(A[1..n, 1..n])
Input: The adjacency matrix A of a digraph with n vertices
Output: The transitive closure of the digraph
R(0) <- A
for k <- 1 to n do
    for i <- 1 to n do
        for j <- 1 to n do
            R(k)[i, j] <- R(k−1)[i, j] or (R(k−1)[i, k] and R(k−1)[k,j])
return R(n)
