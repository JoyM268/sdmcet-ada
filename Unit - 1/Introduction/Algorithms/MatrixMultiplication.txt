Multiplies two square matrices of order n by the definition-based algorithm

MatrixMultiplication(A[0..n−1, 0..n−1],B[0..n−1, 0..n−1])
Input: Two n×n matrices A and B
Output: Matrix C = A*B

for i <- 0 to n−1 do
    for j <- 0 to n−1 do
        C[i, j] <- 0
        for k <- 0 to n−1 do
            C[i, j] <- C[i,j] + A[i,k] ∗ B[k,j]
return C
