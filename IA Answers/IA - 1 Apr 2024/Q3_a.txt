Q3.a. Consider the following recursive algorithm.
Algorithm Riddle(A[0..n-1])
//input: an array A[0..n-1] of real numbers
if n = 1
    return A[0]
else 
    temp <- Riddle(A[0..n − 2])
    if temp ≤ A[n − 1]
        return temp
    else 
        return A[n − 1]
i. What does this algorithm compute?
ii. Set up a recurrence relation for the algorithm's basic operation and solve it.


i. Smallest element in the array
ii. T(n) = T(n - 1) + 1 for n > 1
    T(1) = 0 for n = 1
    (The recurrence relation must be solved in exam step by step to obtain the time complexity.)
    Time complexity: θ(n)
