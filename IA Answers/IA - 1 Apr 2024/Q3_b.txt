Q3.b. Write selection sort algorithm. Write the time complexity of the algorithm.
Demonstrate its working on the following set of numbers:
29 24 15 78 45 37

Sort a given array by selection sort

SelectionSort(A[0..n − 1])
Input: An array A[0..n − 1] of orderable elements
Output: Array A[0..n − 1] sorted in non decreasing order

for i <- 0 to n − 2 do
    min <- i
    for j <- i + 1 to n − 1 do
        if A[j] < A[min] 
            min <- j
    swap A[i] and A[min]

Time complexity: θ(n^2)
(The time complexity should be derived in the exam with proper explanation.)
(Its working should be demontrated in the exam for the given set of numbers.)
